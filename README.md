# ⚽ Football Player Market Value Prediction
**Predicting the market value of professional soccer players using machine learning and data analysis.**

## 📌 Project Overview
🔍 This project was developed as part of my Computer Engineering degree at Universidad Francisco de Vitoria (UFV), Madrid, Spain.

This project presents the development of a **predictive model** to estimate the **market value** of soccer players using **machine learning techniques** and **data analysis**. The model is implemented in **Google Colab** and is based on historical data from **Transfermarkt and FBref**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a **data-driven** model to predict the **market value** of football players.
- Compare different **machine learning algorithms** (XGBoost, LightGBM, RandomForest, SVR).
- Optimize model performance using **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Provide insights through **data visualization**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Development Environment**: Google Colab
- **Data Sources**: Transfermarkt, FBref

## 📊 Data Analysis & Model Development
### 🔹 Data Collection & Cleaning
- Integrated player statistics from **multiple sources**.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data to ensure **consistency**.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized player **value distribution**, **position-based trends**, and **correlation analysis**.
- Used **histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps** to explore relationships.

### 🔹 Machine Learning Models
- Implemented **Random Forest, SVR, XGBoost, and LightGBM** for prediction.
- Used **RandomizedSearchCV** for **hyperparameter tuning**.
- **Evaluated models** using **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**.

### 🔹 Results
- **XGBoost** achieved the **best performance** with the lowest RMSE.
- Developed a **pipeline** for real-time player value prediction.
